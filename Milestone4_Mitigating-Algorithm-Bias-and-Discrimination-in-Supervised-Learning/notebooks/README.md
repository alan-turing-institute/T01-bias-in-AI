There are 3 practice notebooks:

- [Practice Notebook 1: Pre-processing technique: Reweighing for Statistical Parity](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alan-turing-institute/bias-in-AI-course/blob/main/Milestone4_Mitigating-Algorithm-Bias-and-Discrimination-in-Supervised-Learning
/notebooks/Notebook1_Preprocessing_instructions.ipynb) <br>
  Reweighing (Kamiran and Calders, 2012) is a pre-processing technique that amends the dataset to achieve statistical parity. This notebook gives you the opportunity to implement it using AIF360.
  
 - [Practice Notebook 2: In-processing technique: A Reductions Approach to Fairness for Statistical Parity](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G3qb1xfhuiFjfaa1BcrE8PFKFhYrOGeD?usp=sharing) <br>
  The Reductions approach (Agarwal et al 2018) makes use of constrained optimisation to mitigate unwanted bias.  This notebook gives you the opportunity to implement it using Fairlearn.
  
- [Practice Notebook 3: Post-processing technique: Equalised Odds Post-processing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hkLxC3HS9O8baIyoi7FF4eLgj1_kq42G?usp=sharing) <br>
  The Equalised Odds Post-Processing approach flips predictions until a desired error rate distribution between the protected group and the rest of the sample is achieved.  This notebook gives you the opportunity to implement it using AIF360.
  
**Practice Instructions:** <br>
You can chose to download the notebooks on your machine and use them with Jupyter, or open them directly through Google Colab by clicking on the links above.

If the latter:

- Make sure you copy them in your own Google Drive as the original files are not editable.

If you use the notebooks locally:

- The data can be downloaded above (hiring.pkl)
- Make sure to save the data in the same folder as the notebooks.

Note that the data for Milestone 4 is slighlty different than the data for Milestone 3 and 5 (but the data for 3 & 5 is the same).
