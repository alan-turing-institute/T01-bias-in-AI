There are 3 practice notebooks:

- [Practice Notebook 1: Pre-processing technique: Reweighing for Statistical Parity](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19SIPcIkM91J8P6CJOJ6UkWd57W06wTxB?usp=sharing) <br>
  Reweighing (Kamiran and Calders, 2012) is a pre-processing technique that amends the dataset to achieve statistical parity. This notebook gives you the opportunity to implement it using AIF360.
  
 - [Practice Notebook 2: In-processing technique: A Reductions Approach to Fairness for Statistical Parity](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G3qb1xfhuiFjfaa1BcrE8PFKFhYrOGeD?usp=sharing) <br>
  The Reductions approach (Agarwal et al 2018) makes use of constrained optimisation to mitigate unwanted bias.  This notebook gives you the opportunity to implement it using Fairlearn.
  
- [Practice Notebook 3: Post-processing technique: Equalised Odds Post-processing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hkLxC3HS9O8baIyoi7FF4eLgj1_kq42G?usp=sharing) <br>
  The Equalised Odds Post-Processing approach flips predictions until a desired error rate distribution between the protected group and the rest of the sample is achieved.  This notebook gives you the opportunity to implement it using AIF360.
