This milestone is being led by Dr Elizabeth Lomas and Denise Almeida. 

In this four hour sessions we will introduce the legislative and regulatory contexts for AI and considerations within this context for mitigating bias. By the end of this session you will be able to start mapping out the legislative context relating to AI for your own particular organisation and consider the steps you should take to be legally compliant and to mitigate bias from a compliance perspective. The session will be relevant to those interested in learning about AI as well as practitioners developing, deploying and/or using AI.

We have divided the session up into short segments as explained in the introductory film. For each section there is a short film. There are then signposted activities and/or readings. Versions of the films with captioning are provided - we apologise for any innacuracies in the automated transcription. Slides of each film set have been uploaded for reference purposes.
