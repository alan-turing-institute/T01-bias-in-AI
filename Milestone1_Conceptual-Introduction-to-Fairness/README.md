This milestone is being led by Dr Emre Kazim. 

Students of artificial intelligence will be given a conceptual introduction to fairness. These sessions will explore the philosophy of fairness, different notions of fairness and how context impacts how fairness is conceived and applied. By the end of the session you should have a grasp of foundational ideas in this space, from philosophy, to law, and how they relate to fairness concerns in AI development and deployment.
