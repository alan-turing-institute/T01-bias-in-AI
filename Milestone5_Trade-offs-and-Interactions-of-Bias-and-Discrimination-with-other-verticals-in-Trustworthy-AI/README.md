This week's session is being led by Roseline Polle. It should take approximately four hours to complete.

This week, we explore how other verticals of trustworthy AI interact with fairness. For each vertical covered (Explainability, Privacy and Robustness), we give an overview of the vertical itself before exploring its interaction with fairness. 

The session, is divided in two main parts:


**Part 1: Theory.** *(4 videos with slide + supporting "cheatsheet" notebook)*
- [Cheatsheet Notebook](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/bias-in-AI-course/blob/main/Milestone5_Trade-offs-and-Interactions-of-Bias-and-Discrimination-with-other-verticals-in-Trustworthy-AI/Milestone5_Theory_Supporting%20Notebook_CheatSheet.ipynb)
- [Theory 1: Introduction to trustworthy AI](https://youtu.be/aiXSZ5bfmVU)
- [Theory 2: Explainability](https://youtu.be/Dg6NVjNxvRE)
- [Theory 3: Privacy](https://youtu.be/VSIwLkNYK4c)
- [Theory 4: Robustness](https://youtu.be/oeQbTyDEAJY)

**Part 2: Practice.** *(1 notebook)*

We still look at the hiring Supervised Learning problem used for Milestone 3 and 4, where a company uses an algorithm in their hiring process to decide which candidates go to the next round. Candidates are labelled either "pass" (0) or "fail" (1).

**Practice Instructions:** <br>
You can chose to download the notebooks on your machine and use them with Jupyter, or open them directly through Google Colab by clicking on the links above. If the latter, make sure you copy them in your own Google Drive as the original files are not editable.

The data is downloaded directly from openML in the notebooks.
